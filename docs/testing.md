# Testing Strategy for Wellness Buddy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Wellness Buddy application, focusing on ensuring code quality, functionality, and reliability.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

- **Scope**: Individual functions, components, and modules
- **Tools**: Jest
- **Focus**: Testing models, controllers, and middleware in isolation
- **Coverage Target**: 70% code coverage minimum

### Integration Testing

- **Scope**: Interaction between components
- **Tools**: Jest, Supertest
- **Focus**: API endpoints, database operations, authentication flows
- **Coverage Target**: Key user flows and critical paths

## Test Environment

- In-memory MongoDB database for isolated testing
- JWT mocking for authentication tests
- Mock implementations for external dependencies

## Test Categories

### Model Tests

- Validation rules for data models
- Schema constraints
- Default values and timestamps
- Error handling for invalid inputs

### Controller Tests

- Business logic implementation
- Request/response handling
- Error handling
- Data transformation

### Middleware Tests

- Authentication and authorization
- Request validation
- Error handling middleware
- Cross-cutting concerns

### API Route Tests

- Endpoint functionality
- Status codes and response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Query parameters and pagination

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Pull requests to main branch
- Commits to main branch
- Release preparation

## Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in the `/coverage` directory and include:
- Line coverage
- Branch coverage
- Function coverage
- Statement coverage

## Best Practices

1. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) in test cases
2. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
3. Mock external dependencies to focus tests on the component under test
4. Use fixtures for test data to maintain consistency
5. Avoid testing implementation details, focus on behavior
6. Keep tests independent and isolated
