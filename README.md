# Software Architecture Documentation for Wellness Buddy

## 1. Overview

Wellness Buddy is a comprehensive wellness application designed to help users track and improve various aspects of their wellbeing. The system follows a client-server architecture with a microservices-inspired backend and a React-based frontend.

## 2. Architectural Pattern

The system implements a **layered architecture** with microservices principles, providing several key benefits:

- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between data, business logic, and presentation
- **Maintainability**: Modular components can be modified independently
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled according to demand
- **Testability**: Isolated components are easier to test
- **Flexibility**: Services can evolve independently

## 3. System Components

### 3.1 Client-Side Architecture

The frontend application is built using React with the following architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: React components
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Service Layer**: API integration services
- **Routing Layer**: React Router

### 3.2 Server-Side Architecture

The backend follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern with these layers:

- **Routes Layer**: Defines API endpoints
- **Controller Layer**: Handles business logic and request processing
- **Model Layer**: Represents data structures and database interactions
- **Middleware Layer**: Provides cross-cutting concerns like authentication

### 3.3 Database Architecture

MongoDB is used as the primary data store with:

- Document-based collections for user data and wellness metrics
- Mongoose ODM for schema validation and business rules
- Indexes for performance optimization

## 5. Architectural Decisions and Trade-offs

### 5.1 Microservices-Inspired Architecture

**Decision**: We implemented a microservices-inspired approach rather than a pure microservices architecture.

**Rationale**:
- The application is moderately complex but not at the scale requiring fully independent microservices
- Reduced operational complexity while maintaining clear service boundaries
- Single database for simplicity while keeping domain models separate
- Easier development workflow for a small team

**Trade-offs**:
- Some limitations on independent scaling
- Domain coupling is higher than in pure microservices

### 5.2 MongoDB as Database

**Decision**: MongoDB was chosen as the primary database.

**Rationale**:
- Schema flexibility accommodates evolving wellness tracking features
- Document model aligns well with user-centric data
- BSON format naturally represents JSON data from the frontend
- Horizontal scaling capabilities support future growth

**Trade-offs**:
- Less strict data consistency compared to relational databases
- Complex transactions are more challenging

### 5.3 JWT for Authentication

**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with Passport.js integration.

**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication reduces server-side storage requirements
- Simplifies API gateway authorization
- Supports multiple authentication providers (email/password, Google OAuth)
- Better cross-domain support

**Trade-offs**:
- Tokens must be stored securely on the client
- Token revocation is more complex than session-based auth

## 6. API Design

The system employs a RESTful API design with the following principles:

- Resource-based endpoints (e.g., `/api/mood`, `/api/sleep`)
- HTTP methods reflect operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON for data exchange
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Consistent error handling

## 7. Security Architecture

The application implements multiple security layers:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, password hashing with bcrypt
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for resources
- **Input Validation**: Express Validator for request validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and brute force attacks
- **HTTPS**: All communications encrypted in production
- **CORS**: Controlled cross-origin resource sharing

## 8. Scalability Considerations

The architecture supports horizontal scaling through:

- **Stateless API**: No server-side session state
- **Containerization**: Application components can be containerized
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple server instances can serve requests
- **Database Sharding**: MongoDB supports sharding for data distribution
- **Caching**: Opportunities for Redis integration for frequently accessed data

## 9. Testing Strategy

The application employs a multi-level testing approach:

- **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints and service interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: For complete user workflows
- **Load Tests**: For performance under high traffic scenarios

## 10. Future Architecture Expansion

The current architecture allows for several expansion paths:

- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live notifications
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Separate data processing for wellness insights
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling for wellness recommendations
- **Mobile Applications**: Native mobile clients connecting to the same API
- **True Microservices**: Eventual evolution to fully independent services

## 11. Conclusion

The Wellness Buddy architecture balances modern design principles with practical implementation considerations. The layered approach with clean separation of concerns provides a solid foundation for the application while enabling future growth and feature expansion.
